# cquery

[cquery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery) provides extremely fast,
robust, and reliable C++ integration into vscode with a ton of features, like
code lens, references, code completion, semantic highlighting, and much more.

You currently need to install and build the main cquery server (eventually this
will be downloaded for you from prebuilts). See the [Getting
Started](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Getting-started) wiki
entry.

This extension is still in preview. Please see additional documentation at the
main cquery
[wiki](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code).
